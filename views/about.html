  <h1>About Allie</h1>
  <p>"Allie founded Voters For Animal Rights in 2016. In 2020, she ran VFAR’s candidate endorsement process for more than 50 animal rights candidates for New York State Senate and Assembly. In 2019, she co-led the campaign to ban foie gras in NYC. She also helped passed NYC’s laws making it a crime to steal wild birds, and for the creation of the NYC Mayor’s Office of Animal Welfare. During the group’s inaugural year, she helped co-lead the successful campaign to ban wild animals in the circus in NYC, which became law in July 2017. Previously, she lead the Nyclass campaign to ban horse carriages from city streets for over five years. She ran the successful “Anybody But Quinn” campaign to defeat an anti-animal candidate for NYC mayor, getting animal rights into mainstream city politics for the first time. She has worked at the NY State Senate, Obama campaign and the NJ Dept of the Public Advocate. She was named to New York Observer’s “Political Power 80” in 2014 and named to City & State Magazine’s “40 Under 40” political people to watch in 2016.

    She’s an alumni of Florida State University and mom of five rescued cats – Willa, Waffles, Gumball, Croissant, and Barry Manilow. She lives in Bed Stuy, Brooklyn where she is a volunteer TNR (trap-neuter-release) rescuer."</p>

  <h2>Vfar Mission</h2>
  <p>
    "Voters For Animal Rights’ mission is to help elect candidates who support animal protection, lobby for strong laws to stop animal cruelty, and hold elected officials accountable to humane voters.
    
    We work to gain legally enforceable fundamental rights for animals by codifying animal rights into law. VFAR focuses exclusively on political advocacy for animals in New York. We mobilize voters and organize lobbying efforts to give a voice to animals. Through the political process, we are building a coalition of advocates seeking to strike at the root cause of animal abuse and cruelty, which is a lack of fundamental rights and laws to protect them. Check out our 2020-2021 legislative agenda here.
    
    We founded this organization because there is a dire need for a multi-issue political advocacy group specifically for animal protection in New York. Filling this need is especially crucial in the current political climate. If we want to stop the endless cycle of cruelty to animals, we need to change our laws to protect them in the first place — or we’ll just keep chasing our tail. (Pun intended) And to do that, we need to elect compassionate people, train animal advocates to run for office, and organize humane voters."</p>
